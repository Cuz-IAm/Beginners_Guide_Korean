Good, stay right there.
	[wait 2 sec]
The woman across the room, in this chair, is a professional photographer of animals.
	[wait 1 sec]
[fire chair_on trigger]
	[wait 3 sec]
It's your dream to photograph animals professionally.
	[wait 3 sec]
This is your one chance to learn something from her, to gain something, to succeed.
	[wait 4 sec]
Go on, say something to her.
	[wait 3 sec]

	Opt1: Hello.[Play respondA]
	Opt2: Sorry, I have to leave.[Play respondB]
	Opt3: Where is the bathroom?[Play respondC]
}

respondA
{
	[color f8fc25] 
	[wait 2 sec]
Hello? That's it?? 
	[wait 2 sec]
That's not a conversation!
	[wait 3 sec]
You need to actually converse with her, be a human being.
	[wait 3 sec]
Do it again.
	[wait 3 sec]
[play speak2]
}

respondB
{
	[color f8fc25] 
	[wait 2 sec]
You're leaving?? You can't leave!
	[wait 2 sec]
You're letting your animal brain make decisions,
	[wait 2 sec]
be bigger than that and have an actual conversation with her.
	[wait 3 sec]
Do it again.
	[wait 3 sec]
[play speak2]
}

respondC
{
	[color f8fc25] 
	[wait 2 sec]
What are you doing?? 
	[wait 2 sec]
You're deflecting, you're not saying what's actually on your mind.
	[wait 3 sec]
Stop dancing around it and have a conversation with this person.
	[wait 3 sec]
Do it again.
	[wait 3 sec]
[play speak2]

	[color ffffff] 
	Opt1: I'm super super scared right now.[Play respondD]
	Opt2: I like you.[Play respondD]
	Opt3: Here are all of my hopes and dreams:[Play respondD]
}

respondD
{
	[color f8fc25] 
	[wait 2 sec]
No no no! That's not what I said to her at all! 
	[wait 2 sec]
You're completely missing the tone of the conversation, 
	[wait 3 sec]
I was reserved but I knew what I wanted, I was confident. 
	[wait 3 sec]
For some reason it was just that one moment, but I was confident. 
	[wait 3 sec]
Maybe it's that you need a better feel of the setting. There were a lot of people around us.  
	[wait 3 sec]
I'll give you some props to work with. These cones that bounce when you touch them will represent the people nearby.
	[wait 3 sec]
[fire bouncers_on trigger]
	[wait 6 sec]
Now talk to her again!
	[wait 4 sec]
[play speak3]

speak3
{
	[color ffffff] 
	Opt1: You must have worked really hard to get where you are.[Play respondE]
	Opt2: I'll bet you've learned to lean into the pain.[Play respondE]
	Opt3: What are some sacrifices you've had to make?[Play respondE]
}

respondE
{
	[color f8fc25] 
	[wait 2 sec]
You're messing it all up again! 
	[wait 2 sec]
You'll freak her out if the conversation gets that personal that quickly! 
	[wait 3 sec]
Do you not realize how important this was for me? I'll never get another opportunity like this again. 
	[wait 3 sec]
Everything was riding on this!
	[wait 4 sec]
[clear]
	[wait 2 sec]
Hm.....I want to try something.
	[wait 2 sec]
Try stepping back from the stage.
