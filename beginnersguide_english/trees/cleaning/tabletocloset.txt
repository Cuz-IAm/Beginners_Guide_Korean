Darling, let me tell you something.
	[wait 2 sec]
Your house is only as difficult to clean as YOU are.
	[wait 2 sec]
If you're finding the work hard, maybe you have a bit of housekeeping to do before you come to work.
	[wait 4 sec]
Ha! And here I go with another lecture. Of course I would.
	[wait 3 sec]
	[fire VO_5delay trigger]
Don't you worry about all that nonsense, for now just smooth out the rug in the bedroom.

Darling, let me tell you something.
	[wait 2 sec]
In your lifetime, you are going to clean a lot of houses.
	[wait 2 sec]
And among all of those, a few of them will stick out as truly wonderful, beautiful experiences.
	[wait 4 sec]
And none of them will be the ones that were easy.
	[wait 3 sec]
	[fire VO_5delay trigger]
Just something to think about while you smooth out the rug in the bedroom.

Darling, let me tell you something.
	[wait 2 sec]
Whatever work you do, you have absolutely got to own it.
	[wait 2 sec]
Otherwise, it owns you.
	[wait 2 sec]
So why don't we be with the task at hand and leave the future chores to future you.
	[wait 2 sec]
Present you wants to smooth out the rug in the bedroom, believe it or not.
	[wait 2 sec]
	[fire VO_5delay trigger]
Trust me on this one.
