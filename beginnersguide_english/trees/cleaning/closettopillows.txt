Well...
	[wait 2 sec]
I don't enjoy it so much as I need it.
	[wait 2 sec]
While I'm working I feel a kind of calm that rests in the pit of my ribcage.
	[wait 3 sec]
My soul just can't be soothed any other way, it seems.
	[wait 2 sec]
Which I guess is about all that matters!
	[wait 2 sec]
Oh, that and a tidy couch. Would you straighten the pillows on the sofa out here?
	[wait 1 sec]

A friend dragged me along at a time when I was particularly desperate for cash.
	[wait 3 sec]
Turns out I've never felt so good doing something for money in my whole life!
	[wait 3 sec]
Never did like cleaning my own home, I might've got some demons I ain't ready to face yet.
	[wait 3 sec]
Oh, speaking of demons, someone's put this couch all in a mess.
	[wait 2 sec]
Would you come out and straighten these pillows here?

This line of work, you let go of those judgements pretty fast.
	[wait 2 sec]
May not be your apartment, but something in your life needs straightening up.
	[wait 3 sec]
You think you've got nothing that needs cleaning, be careful, because that means it's everything.
	[wait 3 sec]
Any rate, my place is just to see a bit of peace brought here.
	[wait 4 sec]
Speaking of which, the pillows on this couch are a wreck, would you come out and straighten them up?
	[wait 2 sec]
