Opt1: Hey! It's me! I'm you from after you escape the prison! [fire dial1 playsound] [play past2]
}

[wait 2 sec]
You're me?
[wait 2 sec]
...
[wait 2 sec]
So you were trapped in this prison too?
[wait 3 sec]
[fire 18delay trigger]
[play future2]

{
Opt1: Yep, I was in the furniture maze. [fire dial1 playsound] [play past3]
Opt2: Yep, I was in the escape tutorial. [fire dial2 playsound] [play past3]
Opt3: Yep, I was in the reverse prison. [fire dial3 playsound] [play past3]
}

{
[wait 2 sec]
That's where I am right now!
[wait 2 sec]
Oh I'm so glad to know that I get out eventually!
[wait 3 sec]
What's it like to escape?
[wait 3 sec]
[play future3]
}

future3
{
Opt1: Actually, I'm already forgetting what being in the prison was like... [fire dial1 playsound] [play past4a]
Opt2: It's strange, but in a way I kind of miss being in the prison. [fire dial2 playsound] [play past4b]
Opt3: It feels like being completely still and wildly in motion at the same time. [fire dial3 playsound] [play past4c]
}

past4a
{
[wait 2 sec]
Really? How long has it been since you got out?
[wait 3 sec]
[play future4a]
}

future4a
{
Opt1: Years! Like, I've been standing right here working up the nerve to call you! [fire dial1 playsound] [play past5a]
Opt2: Only a few minutes, but somehow it's already fuzzy, kind of like it never happened. [fire dial2 playsound] [play past5b]
}

past5a
{
[wait 2 sec]
Years?? I haven't been here for years, I don't think... 
[wait 3 sec]
[play future5a]
}

future5a
{
Opt1: This is really hard to admit, but I was afraid to make this call. [fire dial1 playsound] [play transition]
Opt2: Time moves differently for you than it does for me. [fire dial2 playsound] [play transition]
Opt3: Maybe the prison is just affecting you in a strange way. [fire dial3 playsound] [play transition]
}

past5b
{
[wait 2 sec]
But this is the worse, most desperate thing I've ever been through!
[wait 3 sec]
How could you possibly forget it? 
[wait 2 sec]
[play future6]
}

future6
{
Opt1: Haha, I promise it's not as bad right now as you think it is. [fire dial1 playsound]  [play transition]
Opt2: You don't ever forget it, you just stop identifying with it. [fire dial2 playsound]  [play transition]
Opt3: Anything can seem infinite when you're drenched in it. [fire dial3 playsound]  [play transition]
}

past4b
{
[wait 2 sec]
Why? Was there anything about it that you felt good about?
[wait 4 sec]
Being here sucks!
[wait 2 sec]
[play future7]
}

future7
{
Opt1: True, maybe I only like things once I don't have them any more. [fire dial1 playsound] [play past7a]
Opt2: It was comfortable, I knew its limits, I knew my place. [fire dial2 playsound] [play past7b]
Opt3: But don't you feel excited about getting out? The promise of freedom? [fire dial3 playsound] [play past7c]
}

past7a
{
[wait 2 sec]
I do that too I guess...
[wait 2 sec]
But is that just how I'm going to be forever?
[wait 2 sec]
I'd really like to change that.
[wait 2 sec]
[play future8]
}

{
Opt1: Maybe? [fire dial1 playsound]  [play transition]
Opt2: No, I think you'll find a way to change. [fire dial2 playsound]  [play transition]
}

{
[wait 2 sec]
Is that good though?
[wait 2 sec]
It's comfortable, but it's inhuman.
[wait 2 sec]
I couldn't live this way...
[wait 2 sec]
[play future9]
}

future9
{
Opt1: You don't need to! You just need to be patient. [fire dial1 playsound]  [play transition]
Opt2: Having limits is way more important than you probably realize right now... [fire dial2 playsound]  [play transition]
Opt3: You'll see what I'm talking about when you've been there for a while longer. [fire dial3 playsound]  [play transition]
}

past7c
{
[wait 2 sec]
Excited? It's the only thing that matters to me!
[wait 3 sec]
It's the only thing keeping me going!
[wait 2 sec]
"Excited" doesn't really do it justice.
[wait 2 sec]
[play future10]

{
Opt1: Exactly! You have something you care about! Something to look forward to. [fire dial1 playsound]  [play transition]
Opt2: You won't always have something that you care about as much as this. [fire dial2 playsound] [play transition]
Opt3: Just be with that enthusiasm for a bit, let it ooze into your flesh. [fire dial3 playsound]  [play transition]
}

{
[wait 2 sec]
Do you feel any different?
[wait 2 sec]
Some times I'm scared I'll get out and then things will be exactly the same as before.
[wait 4 sec]
[play future11]

future11
{
Opt1: No, I'm really the same person now as I was back then. [fire dial1 playsound] [play past11a]

[wait 2 sec]
Oh no, that's awful!
[wait 2 sec]
That's the worst thing I can imagine!

[play future12]
}

future12
{
Opt1: Don't worry! It's actually not a bad thing! I promise. [fire dial1 playsound] [play transition]
Opt2: Well, you get something else in exchange. [fire dial2 playsound] [play transition]
Opt3: The problem is that you don't actually know who you are right now. [fire dial3 playsound] [play transition]
}

Oh good!
[wait 2 sec]
That's so nice to hear.

That makes me feel...really happy.

Opt1: Age just kind of does that, you know? [fire dial1 playsound] [play transition]
Opt2: I'm still me, but I'm not somehow. It's hard to describe. [fire dial2 playsound] [play transition]
Opt3: Remember to enjoy being who you are right now, it won't last. [fire dial3 playsound] [play transition]

Wait, if you're me, then did you get a call from another version of you when you were trapped?

Then can you tell me how to get out?

Maybe I can come find you!

What do I have to do?
